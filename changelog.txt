MailSender v05 finished 23.03.2015 at 8 pm

Changelog:
- multiple accounts support
- all resources moved to one folder 'data'
- added one feature to MailEngine properties file:
props.put("mail.imaps.fetchsize","22020096")
which controls buffer size for session
@see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14833423/javamail-how-to-handle-large-attachments
- increased buffer size in MyMessage.downloadAtt() method to 4096

Two actions above where results of a bug which consisted in 
a problem in downloading attachments from 'hotmail' account.
The downloading seemed stuck, steps above seemed to solve the issue.

--------- PLANS
- creating a class holding all string data which helps to 
change the language of the app.[done]

[01.04.2015]
1) Drafts & Send panels:
	- change in drafts and sent panel so that if no messages are selected 
	in northWesst panels in infoLabel are shown messages
	and messages after deleting mails are shown it that place;

2) AccountsPanel:
	- moving actionListeners to separate classes;
	- fixed functionality of editing accounts and adding them:
	I gave two names for one button, since once it saves new account
	and the other time it saves changes. Accoring to names of this
	button actionListener (AccPnlSaveListener) decides what to do.

3) InboxPanel (MessageDoubleClickedListener)
	- now messages are selected with a single click not by a double click.

2) Changed the style of MailingPanel from "null" to "Layout"

[06.04.2015]
1) 	Added MULTITHREADING to the app. I've multithreaded sending process and 
	updating Inbox process.
2) 	Fixed a bug concerning seeAttButton and objects behind it which didn't disappear
	after sending a message.



















[BUGS]:
	- on exiting accountsPanel there is a JOptionPane after saving edited account
	- you can send e-mail even with blank mailTxtField
